Linear Regression: House Price Prediction

Project Overview

This project implements Simple and Multiple Linear Regression using Python to predict house prices based on various features like area, bedrooms, bathrooms, and stories.
Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features).


---

Objective

Understand and implement simple linear regression (using one feature).

Explore multiple linear regression (using multiple features).

Learn how to evaluate regression models using metrics like MAE, MSE, and R².

Visualize regression results using plots.



---

Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas → Data handling and preprocessing

Scikit-learn → Machine learning (LinearRegression, train-test split, metrics)

Matplotlib → Data visualization



---

Dataset

The dataset used is a House Price dataset (house_prices.csv).

Example columns:

price → Target variable (dependent)

area → House area in square feet

bedrooms, bathrooms, stories → Additional numeric features

mainroad, furnishingstatus → Categorical features (optional for multiple regression)



> Make sure your CSV is in the same folder as the script or provide the correct path.

**Steps Implemented
Steps Implemented

1. Import Libraries: Load necessary Python packages.


2. Load Dataset: Read CSV into Pandas DataFrame.


3. Select Features & Target:

Simple Regression → area as the feature

Multiple Regression → area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories



4. Split Data: Divide dataset into training and testing sets (80%-20%).


5. Train Model: Fit a Linear Regression model using sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression().


6. Make Predictions: Predict house prices on the test set.


7. Evaluate Model: Calculate MAE, MSE, R² to measure accuracy.


8. Interpret Coefficients: Understand the effect of each feature on price.


9. Visualize Results: Plot regression line (for simple regression) to compare predicted vs actual values.




---

Evaluation Metrics

MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.

MSE (Mean Squared Error): Average squared difference between predicted and actual values.

R² Score: Proportion of variance in the target explained by the features.



---

Results

For simple regression (area only), the R² score may be low (~0.27) because house price depends on multiple factors.

Multiple regression with more features improves the model’s predictive power.

Regression coefficients indicate how much the target variable changes with a one-unit change in each feature.



---

How to Run

1. Download the dataset (house_prices.csv).


2. Make sure Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib are installed.


3. Run the script:



python housing_test.py

4. Check the console for evaluation metrics and view the regression plot.
